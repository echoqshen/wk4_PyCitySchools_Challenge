Scores by school size
# Overview of the school district analysis:
## Background
It has brought to the Board's attention that there was evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered.
## Purpose
I have performed steps to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.  Then I repeated the school district analysis that I learned in this module to see how these changes affected the overall analysis.

# Results:
*   How is the district summary affected?    
    - OBSERVATION: Slight downward change in district averages

*   How is the school summary affected?    
    - OBSERVATION: Overall ranking order change due to THOMAS HS, which slipped from 2ND to 13TH position, with the other intervening schools moving up.

*   Recalculate the high- and low-performing schools.
    - OBSERVATION: Relative ranking for THOMAS HS changed from 2ND to 8TH, as it's % OVERALL PASSING number decreased from 91% to 65%.

*   Recalculate the scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.
    - Math and Reading Scores by Grade: 
    Totals for passing math & reading across grades are reduced as all of 9th grade scores are equivalent to failing
    Average scores calculation not significantly affected by removal of 9th grade scores.
    - Scores by school size
    The scores by school size is also slightly affected by excluding the ninth graders’ math and reading scores from  Thomas High School
    - Scores by school type
    The scores by school type size is also slightly affected by excluding the ninth graders’ math and reading scores from  Thomas High School.
    
# Summeary:
The four changes are reflected in the Average Math & Reading scores, % Passing Math and Reading scores, Overall Passing marks and the funding for each student.  The average markings were slight affected but we can see the difference in funding for each students which is ~ approximately $200.  Thomas High School 2nd stop as the top school doe not change at all.
